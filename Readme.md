# Face Recognition System Based on Template Matching in Frequency Domain 
It is  a  new  approach  for  face recognition  system  based  on  template  matching  in  frequency domain. 
The  idea  of  using  template  matching  is  to  design  a specific  Minimum  Average  correlation  energy  filter  (MACE). The  proposed  recognition  technique  is  performed  by  a  cross correlation between the input images and the designed filter. The technique is applied on the ORL database which consists of more than  400 face  images.  
The experimental  results  show  that this technique is powerful and improve the recognition accuracy
